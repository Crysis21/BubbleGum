# BubbleGum - Sweet Android Gradients

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/crysis21/Android/BubbleGum/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/crysis21/Android/BubbleGum/_latestVersion)

BubbleGum was designed to quickly apply gradients into different UI elements of an android app. The overhead and performance impact is minimal, as BubbleGum is based on Android drawables.  

#### Features
* Apply gradient to a view with an animation effect or transition between 2 gradients.
* Created an animated view with a set of gradients that interchange at the specified amount of time.
* It applies a vignetting effect over the gradient to enhance the view. (will become optional in the future)
* Control gradient angle
* Apply the gradient colors at custom positions. If custom positions are not specified, they will be distributed equally.


#### Installation
Add the following line in your build.gradle file

```gradle
implementation 'com.hold1:bubblegum:0.0.1'
```
